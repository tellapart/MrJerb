Contains a wrapper around launching mrjob from the command line.

This launcher doesn't cover all arguments but any args we've run across a need
for at TellApart are in there.

More configuration can be done by launching from within code, but we found that
doing it from the command line was very straight forward when wrapped with
mrjerb.
